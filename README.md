# DHCP
This is the assignment for the course Computer Networks [B-KUL-G0Q43A]. The assignment was done as a team of two students including myself. It consists of building a Server and Client, both of them supporting the DHCP Protocol. The system only support the most important features of the DHCP Protocol (ex. DHCPAck, DHCPDiscover ...).

Implemented according to the specs described at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131.
